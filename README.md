Hello, my name is Cesar Olvera and this is the first assignment by the Microverse Pre Course tab. Its about to replicate the google search webpage. Its not necessary to add any functionality at the moment, but instead to focus into the design and aestetics.

After two days of work i finally get it! It has some issues at the bottom but cant figure it out how to solve it.
